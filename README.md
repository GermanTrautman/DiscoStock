# DiscoStock

Project Description

Summary
Web system, accessible from each bar with a computer with internet connection. The system must allow, issue tickets, control stock, calculate profit per night and generate reports.

problems
• Leaks in stock control (Gifts, consumption of the bar, what arrives at the bowling alley and what there is physically)
• There is no stock load to make the profit closing.
• The ticket issued by the console has many copies (Tickets are truchanded) ---> See method so that they do not adulterate
• Unfriendly inventory.
• Problem with what the publics get out of the bowling alley (number of bottles per public)

Possible solutions
i. To take a more rigorous control of entering the bowling alley and leaving, the system will have stock control, which must be entered into the system each time merchandise enters the bowling alley.
ii. To avoid stock leakage, the system will have all the options that can be given in the bar. Having thus, the possibility of realizing discounts, gifts of drinks / bottles, use of consumptions among other things.
iii. To prevent tickets from being adulterated, the system will print a color ticket that will change depending on the day.
iv. The system will have an inventory that will have all the drinks of the menu, the available bottles and their respective prices.
v. In order to keep track of the alcohol that is released by the public, the system will have a "Public" section in which an account will be kept of what each publication produces per night. (A maximum of bottles / drinks will already be predefined)

Estimate
We already have a base system to boot.
To make the necessary modifications, we will have the work of a senior php programmer, who will be responsible for adding the missing sections.
